Note that definitions of blindness vary in different settings. For international reporting&#44; WHO defines blindness as profound impairment. This definition can be applied to blindness of one eye (369.1&#44; 369.6) and to blindness of the individual (369.0). For determination of benefits in the U.S.A.&#44; the definition of legal blindness as severe impairment is often used.  This definition applies to blindness of the individual only."
